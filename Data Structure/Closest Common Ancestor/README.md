## Closest Common Ancestor

### Input

Input For simplicity, this question uses one non-zero positive integer (the integer is less than or equal to the number of members N) to indicate a family member in the tree. The input contains T test cases (1 <= T <= 1000). Each test case begins with one line containing two integers, the root member number of the tree and the number of family members N in the tree, where 2 <= N <= 100. The following N-1 lines include the information of the members, where each line contains the member number and its parent number. The following one line gives the query, it contains two member numbers which show that David wants to find out these two family membersâ€™ closest common ancestor.

### Output

For each test case print the closest common ancestor in the corresponding family tree on a separate line.

### Sample

| Input                                          | Output |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 1 7 12
37
10 7
4 7
8 3
12 3
6 8
5 8
9 5
1 12
11 4
2 4
6 12 | 3      |

Explanation: The first sample wants to find out the closest common ancestor of the pair 6 and 12. 

And it is 3. (Also the closest common ancestor of 6 and 7 is 7.)
